# Personal Neovim Setup

This is my personal Neovim setup, updated in Dezember 2024 from LazyVim to a own configuration Setup. I'm using Neovim as my main editor for coding and writing. The Setup is manly focused on Golang, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python and Lua.

## Performance

This configuration includes several performance optimizations such as caching of file system operations, consolidated autocmds, and modern API usage. See [PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md](PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for details.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:fschuermeyer/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
```
