# ðŸ’¤ Personal Nvim Setup

This is my personal Neovim Setup based on ([LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)). I use it for my daily work and I'm happy to share it with you. Feel free to use it as a base for your own setup!

## Setup

Setup Neovim on a new System

```shell
git clone git@github.com:fschuermeyer/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
```

On the first Startup use `:MasonLockRestore` to restore the LSP Configuration.
