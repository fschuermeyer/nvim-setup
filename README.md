# ðŸ’¤ Personal Nvim Setup

This is my personal Neovim Setup. I use it for my daily work and I'm happy to share it with you. Feel free to use it as a base for your own setup.

## Setup

Setup Neovim ([LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)) on a new System

```shell
git clone git@github.com:fschuermeyer/nvim-setup.git ~/.config/nvim
```

On the first Startup use `:MasonLockRestore` to restore the LSP Configuration.

### MacOS Setup

If you are on MacOS, i provide a `macos-startup.sh` file this include only my necessary tools for development. You can run this script with the following command:

```shell
sh ~/.config/nvim/macos-startup.sh
```

This Script include my Personal Setup, it's not complete with all the tools you need probably _(It's works on my machine ;) )_.
